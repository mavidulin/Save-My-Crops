#Save My Crops

Save My Crops is web and mobile app for providing growers with alerting system based on crowdsourced data. Web app enables exploring crop fields and reported pests and diseases. Furthermore, growers are provided with tools for mapping their crop fields and reporting occurances of pests and diseases on their crop fields. Mobile app gives growers the ability to easily report pests and diseases on site.

###Description

Save My Crops has a goal to provide tools for growers that can help them protect their crops in early stages of threat occurance nearby. This is achived by implementation of web GIS. By using a web map growers are provided with tools for mapping their crop fields and reporting occurances of pests and diseases on their fields. When threat is reported owners of nearby crops get email notifications immediately. In addition, user can see all received alerts on the web page. Mobile app gives growers the ability to easily report pests and diseases on site without the delay.

Another advantage is using crowdsourced data for science. Scientists can analyze satellite images and have real field data collected by growers. Also, by using the data agriculture scientists can better understand behaviour and spread of diseases and pests.

###The project was done within NASA Space App Challenge 2015. https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org
